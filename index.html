                <p>
                    My name is Scott Mitchell and I graduated from Sonoma State University in December of 2018 with a B.S in Computer Science and a B.A in Mathematics. I was born and raised in the silicon valley area and have lived here my entire life.
                    I became interested in programming back in late middle school around the 8th grade. I originally picked up python 2.7 around that time, but really only got the basics down. I took AP Computer Science in high school
                    and immediately realized this is what I wanted to do for a career. It was challenging but equally rewarding at the same time and I really enjoyed it. My main hobbies include 
                    photography, hiking, gaming and learning anything new. I recently have been studying Japanese in my free time and have found it extremely satisfying to be able to understand bits of another language. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineer, and with work in general, I become very dedicated to my tasks and see them to finish. When I get focused on something I really stick with it until I feel like I've figured something out or made progress.
                    I usually try to keep the mindset of to learn something new for the right task rather than trying to figure out how to do a task with something I already know.
                    For example I would try learning React.js, Vue.js, etc. for building a website rather than trying to figure out how to make a website with something I already know like C++ or Java. I usually tend to pick up things quickly and stick with them. I've learned a lot of things by simply trying various libraries and reading docs.
                    I'm interested in practically every new emerging technology but I find myself more interested in things like Machine Learning, Blockchain, Cryptography and Game Development.

                        My strongest language by far has to be <strong>Python</strong>. It was the first language I learned and I've tried to stay up to date with it ever since. I'm currently using and familiarizing myself with <strong>Python 3.8</strong>.
                        I'm also quite comfortable with C++ and Java as I've used both in fairly large projects. I have used C++ more recently than Java so I would need to refresh myself on it. I'm familiar with other various languages, however I have not used them much. You can find them in list directly below.
                        I've worked with projects on Windows, Linux and Mac but I am more familiar with Windows and Linux.
